# image_classifier_with_CNNs
A machine vision project which uses Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images 

Notes:

- Images have been replaced with public images due to private NDA. Source code remains the same though model performance results / optimization parameters will obviously differ because of differing input data.
