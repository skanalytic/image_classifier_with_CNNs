# image_classifier_with_CNNs
A machine vision project which uses Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images 

Instructions:

- Use X to download input images to feed the classifier (I used images of Big ben and the Taj Mahal but you can use whatever you want!)
- Open X and change the source input file to wherever you saved the input images
- Run the program to create a cluster model of the images 
- Use X to check how well the model performed (obviously for the real assignement we had to infer this) as we did not have labelled data
- Enjoy. Comments and feedback welcome! 

Notes:

- Images have been replaced with public images due to private NDA. Source code remains the same though model performance results / optimization parameters will obviously differ because of differing input data.
